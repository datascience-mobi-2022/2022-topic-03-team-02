This chapter focuses on the process of isolation of ribonucleic acid (RNA) from biological sources enriched in ribonucleases (RNase) and the protocols for the analysis of steady-state transcripts. Steady-state RNA is the one that is isolated from the nucleus or cytoplasm by direct cell lysis. RNA is chemically and biologically more labile at elevated temperatures (65Â°) and in the presence of alkali. These intrinsic handling difficulties are further compounded by aggressive activities of a variety of resilient RNase. Protocols for the isolation of RNA begin with cellular lysis mediated by buffers that typically fall into one of two categories depending on the degree of cellular disruption and concomitant RNase inhibition: (1) those consisting of harsh chaotropic agents such as one of the guanidinium salts, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), N-laurylsarcosine (sarcosyl), urea, phenol, or chloroform, which disrupt the plasma membrane and subcellular organelles and which simultaneously inactivate RNase; and (2) those that gently solubilize the plasma membrane while maintaining nuclear and other organelle integrity, such as the non-ionic, hypotonic lysis buffers. The disadvantage of using gentle lysis buffers is that the lysis buffer alone is not sufficiently chaotropic to fully inhibit RNase activity; and the drawback of harsh chaotropic procedures is that the investigator is not able to discriminate between cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA, as there is no method for separating hnRNA from spliced messenger RNA (mRNA) once these two populations have been mixed.}
