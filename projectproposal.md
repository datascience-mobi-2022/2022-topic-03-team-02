# project proposal

## generel topics
- weekly meetings on Wednesdays, more meetings if necessary

## analysis steps
### part 1 - describing data, reprobuccibility, normalization
- describing structure of data frame
- normalization of data: the amount of each protein should be 100 for every replicate (e.g. amount of protein 1 in all 25 fractions of Ctrl_Rep1 should be 100)
- plotting distribution of random proteins to show data
- reproducibility: why is it important to show reproducibility
- prove reproducibility with qq-plots and correlation between replicates
- last step: mean values of the three replicates 
### part 2 - find maxima for each protein in Ctrl and RNase
- find global maxima -> highest value across all fractions
- find local maxima -> first criteria: each value of the two neighbouring pairs has to be lower as the local maxima (avoid fluctuation bias)
- find local maxima -> second criteria: value of local maxima has to be greater than 4% of total protein amount (100) (avoid background noise)
- criteria for maxima could change during project work 


## project proposal presentation
- relevance and eyample for RNA binding proteins

## questions
- What does "describing the dataset" mean?
- structure of the report
